My first exposure to coding was in college, an introductory programming class where I met data types, variables, functions, infinite loops and recursion for the very first time.  I took the course out of curiosity, a desire to better understand how computers fundamentally do what they do, but not to pursue a major in CompSci.  

Fast forward to now, an artist with a custom built website that, again, just out of curiosity, I started tinkering with.  It all came back to me, the intellectual fascination with how the technology works and ultimately how much I enjoy working under the hood with code.

Web development , the practical know-how to code fused with a passion for art, opens an unlimited world of creativity that I am just starting to explore.  The challenge of meeting the precision required in coding is, as always, a rush!  I look forward to the rewarding  journey promised by this new path.
